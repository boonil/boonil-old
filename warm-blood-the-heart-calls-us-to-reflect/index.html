        <h2>Warm blood,<br> the heart calls us to reflect</h2>
        <p>An action made of signs, objects, shapes and gestures; that unfolds in a sequence of acts, for it to be presented in the public space.</p>
        <p>The idea of healing as human race, comes from the awareness and necessity to face difficult realities in countries in conflict as México or others, and the complicities between many countries, where they sell weapons that perpetuate the state of inequality, exploitation and war in many parts of the world. As the <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/investigation-closes-in-on-german-weapons-company/a-14742625-1" id="G36">german weapons G36 that were illegally sold to Mexico</a> last year, with which many people were killed and injured. This is happening in many places around the world, and one can feel paralyzed in front of millions of things we need to overcome in our global society to become a better society, but we need to heal. And is better if more people put their own intention on it. So based in the traditional rituals of healing in Mexico called “ Las Limpias”, where the healer heals the people from physical, psychological or spiritual pains, I call people to heal the violence and the pain, caused by all the past and ongoing wars, from the collective body. So the action consists of a healing ritual. The body parts made from plaster and paint, appeal to the shock of memory that produces awareness of violence that is exerted to the body, which it’s victim of the prevailing power systems. The image of the bloody body parts, carries a demonstrative force of terror and injustice that corruption and organized crime do against the people. The pain caused by the state of war is stored in the collective memory, during the ritual, the violence, is exorcised of the collective body. </p>
        <p>The public space, as commonplace, is transformed and translated into public life. The public space is inclusive, where the meeting with others happens, where experiences converge, where we, people, can promote culture, looking for spontaneity in terms of use of space, promoting ideas and promoting coexistence, highlighting the concept of public space as a place that belongs to the people.</p>
        <p>The ambition of this project is to get people involved.</p>
