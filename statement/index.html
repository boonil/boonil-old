        <p id="statement">Art, for me, has to do with an ongoing process of research, learning and experimentation. My personality is versatile and in my work I like to explore different means, such as performance, installation, video, animation, sculpture and graphics. What allows me to discover different ways of working with ideas through divers tools and materials. There is a close relationship between the concepts and materials that I choose to work with. The ideas lead me to define the tools and how they are represented, not vice versa. I think about the ways in which a piece can be constituted and interpreted. For me, the act of creation has to do with personal conviction and a strong desire to abstracting the ideas to bring them to the material plane. I am interested in what is built and developed from within. Thus, the issues that I choose to work with, have to do with my personal experience, they do not rely solely on theory. I am inspired by certain problems such as exploitation, violence, sexuality and gender that affect society and define our behavior. However other issues related to the death, the dream, collectivity and intervention in public spaces are also other aspects of my work. The exercise of bringing together the work so far I have developed, allows me to visualize how the speeches are woven, that in deep layers touch each other, revealing my interest in understanding the contemporary context in which I live. I think is very important to reflect on the reality that surrounds us, not only to understand where we come from and the problems we face as a social group, but also to influence the sensitivity and the possibilities to overcome those problems. Through art, I find a special freedom for expression and social engagement. And I look forward to the challenges of creative experiences that allow me to continue my future ambitions in art practice.</p>
